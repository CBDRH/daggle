In order to quantify how much of the effect of exercise on mood was attributable to sleep quality, Grace would need to compare the total effect to the

<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-2743c06a3b2d505d67c6">{"x":{"opts":{"content":"<p class=\"helpBox\">The direct effect is the portion of the total effect that goes directly from the exposure to the outcome (X â†’ Y) rather than being mediated through some other variable<\/p>"},"text":"direct effect"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
</span>
of exercise on mood.
  
</p>
<p>To isolate the direct effect, any causal paths that include mediators
must be closed (in addition to closing any open non-causal paths). Just
like in the confounding example, a path with a mediator can be closed by
controlling for the mediator in the analysis.</p>
