<p>Dr Linda Goodes, a paediatric dietitian, read a news article
reporting that the prevalence of obesity is increasing among children
and wondered whether this could relate to greater time spent using
screen-based devices such as computers, tablets and mobile phones.</p>
<p>Linda decided to explore the research question <em><strong>Does an
increasing amount of screen time cause obesity?</strong></em></p>
<p>This potential relationship is represented in the DAG by the directed
arrow from exposure X (Screen time) to outcome Y (Obesity), X â†’ Y.</p>
<p>You should be able to see an example each of a confounder, a collider
and a mediator in this DAG. Given what you learnt in the earlier
examples, what would you condition on to estimate the
<strong>total</strong> effect of screen time on obesity?</p>
<p>Enter your solution and check the result.</p>
