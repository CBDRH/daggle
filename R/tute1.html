<p>Marie Freeman, an emergency department triage nurse, noted that
patients presenting with severe sunburn often reported recently eating
ice-cream. Marie started to wonder <em><strong>Does eating ice-cream
cause sunburn?</strong></em></p>
<p>
This hypothetical relationship is represented in the directed acyclic graph (DAG) by the

<span class="tippy html-widget html-fill-item-overflow-hidden html-fill-item" height="500" id="htmlwidget-08ddbca066cde04c4683" width="960"></span>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-08ddbca066cde04c4683">{"x":{"opts":{"content":"<p class=\"helpBox\">A directed path on a causal DAG is any path between the exposure and outcome where all of the arrows point towards the exposure. This is also referred to as a causal path<\/p>"},"text":"directed path"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
</span>
from exposure X (Ice-cream) to outcome Y (Sunburn), X → Y.
</p>
<p>Marie also knew that more people eat ice-cream on sunny days and that
sunburn is more common on sunny days too. Both of these assumptions are
represented on the DAG. The arrow X ← Z represents the effect of
sunshine on ice-cream consumption and the arrow Z → Y represents the
effect of sunshine on sunburn. Sunshine is a common cause of the
exposure and outcome. In epidemiological terms we call this a
confounder.</p>
<p>
Combined, these assumptions result in an open
<span style="color:#4FBAE4; font-weight:bold">
<span class="tippy html-widget html-fill-item-overflow-hidden html-fill-item" height="500" id="htmlwidget-ff3273827dcbbc1e50ce" width="960"></span>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-ff3273827dcbbc1e50ce">{"x":{"opts":{"content":"<p class=\"helpBox\">A non-causal path on a DAG is a path that connects the exposure and outcome where one or more arrows points backwards towards the exposure<\/p>"},"text":"non-causal path"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
</span>
between Ice-cream and Sunburn X ← Z →Y. Non-causal paths are easy to spot on a DAG because one or more arrows on the path point back towards the exposure.
</p>
<p>This non-causal path is also considered open because it can transmit
statistical association: any observed correlation between Ice-cream and
Sunburn could be due to confounding by Sunshine. To determine whether
there is a causal effect of Ice-cream on Sunburn Marie needs to close
the non-causal path.</p>
<p>To close the non-causal path X ← Z → Y Marie must somehow control for
Z in the analysis. In practice, there are many ways to do this. For
example, by including the amount of sunshine received as a covariate in
a regression analysis.</p>
<p>Here in the daggle app you can click on a node to “control” for that
variable. The node will change from a grey circle to a pink square to
indicate that the variable should be controlled for in the analysis. So
what should Marie control for to test the hypothesis that eating
ice-cream cause sunburn? Enter your solution and check the result.</p>
