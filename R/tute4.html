<p>Noor Ahmed, an Infectious Diseases ward nurse, noticed that patients
with coronavirus disease were often smokers. Noor asked the question:
<em><strong>Does smoking increase the risk of being infected with
coronavirus?</strong></em></p>
<p>This potential relationship is represented in the DAG by the directed
arrow from exposure X (Smoking) to outcome Y (Coronavirus), X → Y.</p>
<p>Noor wanted to investigate this question using electronic hospital
records to identify smoking status and coronavirus infection for
admitted patients. However, their colleague pointed out that this could
be problematic because smoking and coronavirus were both risk factors
for hospitalisation.</p>
<p>The DAG shown here reflects this perspective. We can see the
assumptions that Smoking increases the risk of Hospitalisation (X → Z)
and Coronavirus increases the risk of Hospitalisation (Y → Z). The path
X → Z ← Y is a non-causal path between Smoking and Coronavirus but
importantly it is not an <em>open</em> path.</p>
<p>This is because here Hospitalisation is a special type of variable
known as a ‘Collider’, a variable that is caused by both the exposure
and the outcome. Paths with uncontrolled colliders are closed such that
no statistical association is transmitted along these paths. Think of it
like streams of water arriving at the same point from two directions,
the streams collide and the water can’t go anywhere, the pathway is
blocked.</p>
<p>If Noor decided to investigate this question using hospital records
their analysis would only include data for individuals who were
hospitalised. This would stratify the population and effectively adjust
for hospitalisation status in the analysis. By using hospital data they
would have opened a non-causal pathway thus creating an alternate route
for the association between smoking and COVID-19 infection and more
importantly, potentially introducing bias on the estimate of smoking on
coronavirus. This phenomenon is known as collider bias or collider
stratification bias and happens more often than you would think.</p>
<p>So, should Noor investigate their research question using electronic
health records (effectively controlling for hospitalisation status)?
