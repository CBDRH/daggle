<p>As we saw in earlier examples, researchers are sometimes interested
in the <strong>direct</strong> effect of an exposure on an outcome. To
isolate the direct effect means that any mediators need to be controlled
for. However, in doing so the researcher can inadvertently introduce
bias. This can happen if a mediator on the exposure-outcome path is also
a collider on a different path between the exposure and outcome:
controlling for a collider will open this latter path. The resulting
bias is known as collider bias or collider stratification bias.</p>
<p>In this example, Armin Perez, a substance use disorder counsellor,
noted that many of his clients with opioid use disorder had histories of
traumatic childhood experiences. He decided to explore the question
<em><strong>Does childhood abuse have a direct effect on the risk of
opioid use disorder later in life?</strong></em></p>
<p>This hypothesised relationship is represented in the DAG by the
directed arrow from exposure X (Childhood abuse) to outcome Y (Opioid
use disorder), X → Y.</p>
<p>There could be a number of possible mediators on this pathway such as
chronic pain and mental health issues. In this example we are only
considering a mediated effect through Chronic pain (X → Z1 → Y). Armin
also believes that Chronic pain and Opioid use disorder can also both be
caused by Unintentional injury (Z1 ←Z2 → Y). This means that as well as
being a mediator on the causal path, Chronic pain (Z1) is a collider on
the path between Childhood abuse (X) and Unintentional injury (Z2).
Unintentional injury is an example of a mediator-outcome confounder.
Controlling for chronic pain will risk introducing collider bias by
opening the non-causal path X → Z1 ←Z2 → Y.</p>
<p>All is not lost - Armin will still be able to estimate the direct
effect of childhood abuse on opioid disorder without introducing
collider bias provided he can also close the non-causal path that is
opened by controlling for the mediator chronic pain.</p>
<p>What should Armin control for to estimate the <strong>direct</strong>
effect of childhood abuse on opioid use disorder?</p>
