Dr Linda Goodes, a paediatric dietitian, read a news article reporting that the prevalence of obesity is increasing among children and wondered whether this could relate to greater time spent using screen-based devices such as computers, tablets and mobile phones. 

Linda decided to explore the research question _**Does an increasing amount of screen time cause obesity?**_

This potential relationship is represented in the DAG by the directed arrow from exposure X (Screen time) to outcome Y (Obesity), X → Y.

You should be able to see an example each of a confounder, a collider and a mediator in this DAG. Given what you learnt in the earlier examples, what would you condition on to estimate the **total** effect of screen time on obesity? 

Enter your solution and check the result.
