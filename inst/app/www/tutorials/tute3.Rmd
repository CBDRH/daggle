  ")
```

To isolate the direct effect, any causal paths that include mediators must be closed (in addition to closing any open non-causal paths). Just like in the confounding example, a path with a mediator can be closed by controlling for the mediator in the analysis.

Enter your solution to identify the **direct** effect of exercise on mood.
